## ‚è±Ô∏è Duration: 25 minutes

## üéì Schema Compatibility Fundamentals

### Understanding Compatibility Levels

```
You: "Explain the different schema compatibility levels and when to use each one"

Claude: I'll explain the schema compatibility levels and their use cases for safe evolution.

**Schema Compatibility Levels:**

üìà **BACKWARD (Most Common)**
- **Rule**: New schema can read data written with previous schema
- **Use Case**: Consumer applications are updated first
- **Allowed Changes**: Add optional fields, remove default values
- **Example**: Adding optional "phone_number" field to user profile

üìâ **FORWARD** 
- **Rule**: Previous schema can read data written with new schema  
- **Use Case**: Producer applications are updated first
- **Allowed Changes**: Remove optional fields, add default values
- **Example**: Removing deprecated "legacy_id" field

üîÑ **FULL**
- **Rule**: Both backward AND forward compatible
- **Use Case**: Gradual rollouts with mixed versions
- **Allowed Changes**: Very limited - mostly metadata changes
- **Example**: Updating field documentation

‚ùå **NONE**
- **Rule**: No compatibility enforced
- **Use Case**: Breaking changes during major versions
- **Risk**: Can break existing consumers/producers

**Recommendation**: Start with BACKWARD compatibility for most use cases.
```

## üîß Hands-On Evolution Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Backward Compatible Evolution (5 minutes)

#### Add International Support to User Profile

```
You: "I need to add international support to our user profile schema. Add country_code, language_preference, and timezone fields while maintaining backward compatibility."

Claude: I'll evolve your user profile schema to support international users while ensuring all existing consumers continue working.

[Analyzes current user-profile schema]

**Current Schema (v2)**: user_id, email, name, preferences, shipping_address

**International Enhancement Plan:**
- country_code (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2, optional with default)
- language_preference (ISO 639-1 language code, optional)  
- timezone (IANA timezone identifier, optional)

[Performs compatibility check]

‚úÖ **Compatibility Analysis:**
- All new fields are optional with sensible defaults
- Existing consumers will continue working unchanged
- New consumers can leverage international features
- Data migration can happen gradually

[Registers evolved schema]

‚úÖ **Schema Evolution Successful!**
- **New Version**: 3
- **Compatibility**: BACKWARD with v1 and v2
- **New Fields Added**: 3 international support fields
- **Consumer Impact**: Zero - all changes are additive and optional

**Evolved Schema Structure:**
```json
{
  "fields": [
    // ... existing fields ...
    {
      "name": "country_code",
      "type": "string",
      "default": "US",
      "doc": "ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code"
    },
    {
      "name": "language_preference", 
      "type": "string",
      "default": "en",
      "doc": "ISO 639-1 language code for user interface"
    },
    {
      "name": "timezone",
      "type": "string", 
      "default": "UTC",
      "doc": "IANA timezone identifier for user's location"
    }
  ]
}
```
```

#### Verify Backward Compatibility

```
You: "Test that version 3 can still process data written with version 1 and 2"

Claude: I'll verify that your new schema version can safely process data from all previous versions.

[Runs compatibility verification tests]

üß™ **Backward Compatibility Test Results:**

**v1 Data ‚Üí v3 Schema**: ‚úÖ **PASS**
- Missing fields filled with defaults
- All v1 fields processed correctly  
- No data loss or corruption

**v2 Data ‚Üí v3 Schema**: ‚úÖ **PASS** 
- Shipping address preserved correctly
- International fields populated with defaults
- Seamless data processing

**Real-World Test Scenarios:**
‚úÖ Legacy mobile app (v1) data processed correctly
‚úÖ Web application (v2) data migrated seamlessly  
‚úÖ New international app (v3) supports all features

**Migration Strategy:**
- Existing consumers: No changes required
- New deployments: Can leverage international features immediately
- Gradual rollout: Mix of versions can coexist safely
```

### Scenario 2: Forward Compatible Evolution (5 minutes)

#### Remove Deprecated Fields Safely

```
You: "We have a deprecated 'legacy_user_id' field that we want to remove. How do I do this safely?"

Claude: I'll help you safely remove the deprecated field using forward compatibility to ensure existing producers can still write data.

[Analyzes schema for deprecated field usage]

**Current Situation Analysis:**
- Field: legacy_user_id (string, optional)
- Usage: 12% of producers still include this field
- Risk: Removing immediately would break those producers

**Forward Compatible Removal Strategy:**

**Step 1: Mark for Deprecation** (Current)
```json
{
  "name": "legacy_user_id",
  "type": ["null", "string"],
  "default": null,
  "doc": "DEPRECATED: Will be removed in v5. Use user_id instead."
}
```

**Step 2: Set Compatibility to FORWARD** 
[Updates compatibility setting]

**Step 3: Remove Field in New Version**
[Creates v4 without legacy_user_id field]

‚úÖ **Forward Compatible Removal Complete!**

**Results:**
- **Schema v4**: legacy_user_id field removed
- **Compatibility**: FORWARD - old producers can still write data
- **Consumer Impact**: Consumers must handle missing field gracefully
- **Migration Path**: Producers have time to update before BACKWARD enforcement

**Verification:**
‚úÖ v3 producers can write to v4 consumers (field ignored)
‚úÖ v4 consumers handle missing field correctly
‚úÖ Data integrity maintained throughout transition
```

### Scenario 3: Breaking Change Management (8 minutes)

#### Handle Required Field Addition

```
You: "We need to add a required 'email_verified' boolean field for compliance, but this will break compatibility. What's the safest approach?"

Claude: I'll design a safe migration strategy for adding a required field without breaking existing systems.

[Analyzes impact of required field addition]

‚ö†Ô∏è **Breaking Change Detected:**
- Adding required field breaks BACKWARD compatibility
- Existing data lacks email_verified value
- Existing producers don't provide this field

**Multi-Phase Migration Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Optional Introduction (Weeks 1-2)**
```json
{
  "name": "email_verified",
  "type": "boolean", 
  "default": false,
  "doc": "Email verification status - will become required in v6"
}
```

[Registers v4 with optional field]

**Phase 2: Data Backfill (Weeks 2-3)**
- Populate email_verified for existing users based on verification logs
- Update all producers to include field
- Monitor adoption across services

**Phase 3: Enforcement (Week 4)**
[Updates schema to remove default, making field required]

```json
{
  "name": "email_verified",
  "type": "boolean",
  "doc": "Email verification status - REQUIRED for compliance"
}
```

[Sets compatibility to NONE temporarily for breaking change]

‚úÖ **Breaking Change Migration Complete!**

**Migration Results:**
- **Phase 1**: 100% backward compatibility maintained
- **Phase 2**: All producers updated, data backfilled
- **Phase 3**: Required field enforced safely
- **Compliance**: Email verification now mandatory
- **Zero Downtime**: No service interruptions during migration

**Lessons Learned:**
‚úÖ Gradual migration prevents service disruptions
‚úÖ Communication plan kept all teams informed  
‚úÖ Data backfill ensured compliance for existing users
‚úÖ Monitoring confirmed successful adoption
```

#### Implement Breaking Change Workflow

```
You: "Create a standardized workflow for future breaking changes to prevent issues"

Claude: I'll establish a comprehensive breaking change workflow that ensures safety and team coordination.

**üö® Breaking Change Workflow Process:**

**Step 1: Impact Assessment (Week -4)**

```

## üîç Advanced Evolution Patterns (5 minutes)

### Schema Refactoring with Union Types

```
You: "I need to refactor our payment method field from a simple string to support multiple payment types with different fields"

Claude: I'll help you refactor the payment method using union types to support complex payment data while maintaining compatibility.

**Current Schema:**
```json
{
  "name": "payment_method",
  "type": "string",
  "doc": "Payment method: card, paypal, etc."
}
```

**Refactored Schema with Union Types:**
```json
{
  "name": "payment_method",
  "type": [
    "string",  // Backward compatibility
    {
      "type": "record",
      "name": "PaymentDetails",
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "type",
          "type": {
            "type": "enum",
            "name": "PaymentType", 
            "symbols": ["CREDIT_CARD", "PAYPAL", "BANK_TRANSFER", "CRYPTO"]
          }
        },
        {
          "name": "card_details",
          "type": ["null", {
            "type": "record",
            "name": "CardDetails",
            "fields": [
              {"name": "last_four", "type": "string"},
              {"name": "brand", "type": "string"},
              {"name": "expiry_month", "type": "int"},
              {"name": "expiry_year", "type": "int"}
            ]
          }],
          "default": null
        },
        {
          "name": "paypal_details", 
          "type": ["null", {
            "type": "record",
            "name": "PayPalDetails",
            "fields": [
              {"name": "payer_id", "type": "string"},
              {"name": "email", "type": "string"}
            ]
          }],
          "default": null
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

‚úÖ **Complex Refactoring Successful!**

**Benefits:**
- **Backward Compatible**: Still accepts string values
- **Future Ready**: Supports rich payment data structures
- **Type Safe**: Enum ensures valid payment types
- **Extensible**: Easy to add new payment methods

**Migration Path:**
1. Deploy union schema (accepts both formats)
2. Update producers to use new structure
3. Migrate existing string data to structured format
4. Remove string union option in future version
```

### Schema Inheritance Patterns

```
You: "We have multiple event types that share common fields. How do I design schemas to avoid duplication while keeping them evolvable?"

Claude: I'll design a schema inheritance pattern using Avro that promotes reusability while maintaining evolution flexibility.

**Base Event Schema:**
```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "BaseEvent",
  "namespace": "com.example.events",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "event_id", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "timestamp", "type": "long"},
    {"name": "user_id", "type": ["null", "string"], "default": null},
    {"name": "session_id", "type": ["null", "string"], "default": null},
    {"name": "metadata", "type": ["null", "string"], "default": null}
  ]
}
```

**Specific Event Schemas:**
```json
{
  "type": "record", 
  "name": "UserLoginEvent",
  "namespace": "com.example.events",
  "fields": [
    {"name": "base", "type": "BaseEvent"},
    {"name": "login_method", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "ip_address", "type": "string"},
    {"name": "user_agent", "type": "string"}
  ]
}
```

**Polymorphic Event Union:**
```json
{
  "type": "record",
  "name": "EventEnvelope", 
  "fields": [
    {
      "name": "event",
      "type": [
        "UserLoginEvent",
        "UserLogoutEvent", 
        "OrderCreatedEvent",
        "PaymentProcessedEvent"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

‚úÖ **Schema Inheritance Pattern Implemented!**

**Advantages:**
- **DRY Principle**: Common fields defined once
- **Type Safety**: Specific event types enforced
- **Evolvable**: Base schema can evolve independently
- **Polymorphic**: Single topic can handle multiple event types
```

## ‚úÖ Evolution Best Practices

### Schema Evolution Checklist

```
You: "Create a checklist I can use for all schema evolution decisions"

Claude: I'll create a comprehensive schema evolution checklist to ensure safe changes every time.
